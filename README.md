Astrospace is a one stop destination for astro enthusiasts all over the world. It can be used to find useful information related to the night sky that may help while you're out stargazing. Astrospace will show you potential Shooting Stars in the night sky, the time that they may appear, their distance from the earth, the time you have left to stargaze until the sun rises, or time remaining until the sun sets, the current phase of the moon and information about it, and a lot more!

This Web Application was built using Vue, and makes use of several APIs to fuction. It is the perfect companion for stargazers on a night of stargazing.

## Finding Near Earth Objects
Use the Near Earth Object section to find NEOs that may appear in your night sky within the next 24 hours, or within the week. Objects with a lower miss distance may be more visible in the night sky.

## Time until Sunrise / Sunset
Determine the estimated amount of time remaining on your night out, or the time remaining until you can start stargazing, by keeping an eye on the expected Sunrise and Sunset time.

## Phases of the Moon
Astrospace shows you the current phase of the moon. It also shows where it may be positioned in the night sky along with additional facts about it that may be useful while stargazing
